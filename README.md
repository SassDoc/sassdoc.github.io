## Building

### `make`

Make everything (all the below).

### `make changelog`

Update `changelog/index.md` from
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SassDoc/sassdoc/master>.

### `make preview`

Make an up to date preview of the default theme in
`assets/image/preview-image.png`.

### `make themes`

Do everything needed for the theme gallery to work:

1. In `theme-gallery`, fetch all the themes defined in `themes.mk`,
   render them in `preview` and generate thumbnails in `thumbs`.
2. Generate `_data/themes.yml` from the `package.json` of each theme
   previously downloaded.

To update the themes, run `make update && make themes` (this shouldn't
do anything if no theme was updated).
